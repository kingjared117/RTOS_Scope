# RTOS_Scope
This is a RTOS scope that was done for WPI schoolwork.  This fully threaded project uses a series of tasks to allow the adc to read and map out a waveform.  Using a hardware interrupt on the ADC a large buffer of ADC values is quickly filled in.  A semaphore is used so that the ADC values are not overwritten while they are sent a waveform task that draws the values on the screen.  The oscilscope has the functionality to change the viewing axises using the built in buttons and to swithc into FFT mode.  A mailbox was used make sure the buttons were not getting overwritten by the interupts
